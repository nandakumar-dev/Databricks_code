As a part of this change, we are also instituting a policy that all code that makes its way into dev must undergo a PR before making its way there. One thing we need to handle as a part of this transition is ensuring that all of the code that was previously committed to dev without review gets a review!
So, as a result, we have moved all code that was previously in dev to a new branch called ze-staging as of 2024-03-18 10:00:00 PST.
Determine each logical “set” of dag files that are related to one another
In your terminal, run git fetch
In your terminal, run git switch ze-staging
In your terminal, run git checkout -b <INDIVIDUAL BRANCH NAME HERE>
In your terminal, run git add <FULL PATH TO FILE> <FULL PATH TO ANOTHER FILE IN SET> <...> <FULL PATH TO LAST FILE IN SET>
In your terminal, run git commit -m "<DESCRIPTIVE BUT DISTINCT SUMMARY HERE>" -m "<DESCRIPTIVE BUT MORE VERBOSE EXPLANATION OF WHAT THIS COMMIT CONTAINS HERE>"
In your terminal, run git push
Initiate PR from <INDIVIDUAL BRANCH> to <dev>
Repeat the above process for each “set” of dag files that need to be merged to <dev>
Let us know if you have any further questions!
